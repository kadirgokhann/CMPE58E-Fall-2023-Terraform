As you see in the pictures, terraform is awesome. You can manage all the devOps with just these files. Actuaally,
before this cource I was using management console to edit things. Now i can see that it could be so problematic. In
this way, I can control everything with just one file. I can create, delete, update, etc. Thank you for teaching me
this awesome tool. I will use it in my future projects. With this second project, I am more confident about terraform and
aws CLI.
